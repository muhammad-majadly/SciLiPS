        "Reconstructing human-object interaction in 3D from a single RGB image is a challenging task and existing data driven methods do not generalize beyond the objects present in the carefully curated 3D interaction datasets. Capturing large-scale real data to learn strong interaction and 3D shape priors is very expensive due to the combinatorial nature of human-object interactions. In this paper, we propose ProciGen (Procedural interaction Generation), a method to procedurally generate datasets with both, plausible interaction and diverse object variation. We generate 1M+ human-object interaction pairs in 3D and leverage this large-scale data to train our HDM (Hierarchical Diffusion Model), a novel method to reconstruct interacting human and unseen object instances, without any templates. Our HDM is an image-conditioned diffusion model that learns both realistic interaction and highly accurate human and object shapes. Experiments show that our HDM trained with ProciGen significantly outperforms prior methods that require template meshes, and our dataset allows training methods with strong generalization ability to unseen object instances. Our code and data are released."

        "Modelling interactions between humans and their surroundings is important for applications like creating realistic avatars, robotic control and gaming. In this paper, we address the task of jointly reconstructing human and object from a monocular RGB image, without any prior object templates. This is very challenging due to depth-scale ambiguity, occlusions, diverse human pose and object shape variations. Data-driven methods have shown great progress in reconstructing humans [31, 41, 46, 69–71, 85] or objects [55, 112] from monocular inputs thanks to large-scale datasets [1, 9, 12, 19, 37, 63, 94, 108]. However, methInteraction pose Our diffusion model Input image Train only on our synthetic data Output: 3D human, high-fidelity object shape and contact Object shape Our dataset: synthetic interaction with diverse object shapes Figure 1. Given a single RGB image, our method trained only on our proposed synthetic interaction dataset, can reconstruct the human, object and contacts, without any predefined template meshes. ods for joint interaction reconstruction are still constrained by the amount of available data. Recent datasets like BEHAVE [7], InterCap [35] capture real interactions with 10 to 20 different objects, which is far away from the number of objects in reality: the chair category from ShapeNet [12] alone has more than 6k different shapes. Training on these real datasets has limited generalization ability to unseen objects (Sec. 4.3). Capturing real interaction data with more objects is prohibitively expensive due to the combinatorial nature: the number of humans times the number of objects leads to a huge number of variations. This motivates us to generate synthetic data which has been shown effective for pre-training reconstruction methods [9, 29, 55, 63, 70]. Synthesizing realistic interaction for different objects is non-trivial due to variations of object topology, geometry details and complex interaction patterns. To address this, we propose Procedural interaction Generation (ProciGen), a method to generate interaction data with diverse object This CVPR paper is the Open Access version, provided by the Computer Vision Foundation. Except for this watermark, it is identical to the accepted version; the final published version of the proceedings is available on IEEE Xplore.",
        "shapes. We design our method based on the key idea that the way humans interact with objects of the same category is similar. And despite the geometry variations, one can still establish semantically meaningful correspondence between different objects. More specifically, we train an autoencoder to obtain correspondences between different objects from the same category, which are then used to transfer contacts from already captured human-object interactions to new object instances. Our method is scalable and allows the multiplicative combination of datasets to generate over a million interactions with more than 21k different object instances, which is not possible via real data capture. Current reconstruction methods [7, 60, 95, 96] are not only bottle-necked by data. Template-based methods [7, 95, 96] cannot generalize to unseen objects as they are trained only for specific object templates. Template free methods like PC2 [60] cannot separate human and object, and have limited shape accuracy. See Tab. 1 for detailed comparison. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hierarchical Diffusion Model (HDM), that predicts accurate shapes and reasons about human-object semantics without using templates. Our key idea is to decompose the combinatorial interaction space into separate human and object sub-spaces while preserving the interaction context. We first use a diffusion model to jointly predict human, object and segmentation labels, and then use two separate diffusion models with cross attention that further refine the separate predictions. We evaluate our data generation method ProciGen, and model HDM, on BEHAVE [7] and InterCap [35]. Experiments show that HDM with ProciGen significantly outperforms CHORE [95] (which requires object templates) and PC2 [60]. Our ProciGen dataset also significantly boosts the performance of PC2 and HDM. Methods trained on our synthetic ProciGen dataset show strong generalization ability to real images even though the objects are unseen. In summary, our key contributions are: • We introduce the first procedural interaction generation method for synthesizing large-scale interaction data with diverse objects. With this, we generate 1M+ interaction images with 21k+ objects paired with 3D ground truth. • We propose a hierarchical diffusion model that can faithfully reconstruct human and object shapes from monocular RGB images without relying on template shapes. • Our dataset and code are publicly released."

CHORE [95] reconstructs high shape fidelity with known template meshes but does not generalize to new object instances. PC2 [60] is template-free but its shape predictions lack fidelity and generalization ability is constrained by existing datasets. Training PC2 with our ProciGen dataset allows better generalization but it cannot reason contacts. Our proposed data generation together with our hierarchical diffusion model can predict accurate shapes, generalize to unseen objects and reason about interaction semantics. of works model full body interacting with dynamic large objects [25, 27, 39, 40, 44, 53, 64, 78, 91, 100, 113]. BEHAVE [7] and follow up works [35, 109] capture interaction datasets, which allow training and benchmarking methods [97] for reconstructing 3D human-object from single RGB images [90, 95, 110] or videos [96]. Despite impressive results, they require predefined mesh templates, which limits applicability to new objects. Our method is templatefree and generalizes well to unseen objects. Synthetic Datasets are powerful resources to deep networks. For humans, synthetic rendering of 3D scans [1, 4, 63, 84, 103] are used extensively to train human reconstruction methods [5, 6, 18, 70, 71, 81, 98, 99]. Recent work BEDLAM [9] showed that training purely on synthetic datasets [9, 63] allows strong generalization. Orthogonal to these, large scale 3D object CAD model datasets [12, 94] are also used to pretrain backbone models[38, 51, 62, 107]. Other works [20, 23, 67, 93] consider generating diverse scenes. While being useful for humans, objects or scenes respectively, they do not consider interactions. Our proposed approach can generate millions of interactions with diverse object shapes, allowing for training interaction reconstruction models with great generalization ability. Diffusion-based Reconstruction. Diffusion models [32, 76] have been shown powerful for 3D reconstruction of human [36, 48] and objects [55, 60, 72]. These works distil pretrained 2D diffusion model [36, 48, 59, 65, 72, 104, 118] or fine-tune diffusion model [54, 55, 73] for 3D reconstruction from images. Recent works also propose imageconditioned point diffusion models for reconstruction [60, 87]. Despite remarkable results, they only model the distribution of single shapes, while our method can learn the complex interaction space with high shape fidelity.",
        "We first introduce our method to generate large amounts of interaction data with diverse object shapes in Sec. 3.1. This data allows us to train our novel diffusion model with strong generalization ability, which is explained in Sec. 3.2.",
        "Shape database Dense correspondence Interaction data with diverse object shapes Autoencoder Contact transfer Seed interaction & new object Joint optimization Object & human initialization B C D E A Clothing, texture and rendering Figure 2. Our procedural interaction generation method. Given a seed interaction and a new object from the same category (A), we use a network to compute dense correspondences (B, Sec. 3.1.1), which allows us to transfer contacts and initialize the new object (C, Sec. 3.1.2). We further optimize the human and object poses to avoid interpenetration while satisfying the transferred contacts (D, Sec. 3.1.3). We then add clothing and textures to render images, leading to a large interaction dataset with diverse object shapes (E, Sec. 3.1.4). 3.1. ProciGen: Procedural Interaction Generation Given a small seed dataset of captured human-object interactions and datasets of various object models, we aim to generate a large-scale interaction dataset with diverse object shapes. Via multiplicative scaling, it would allow generating enormous data which is not possible by capturing real data. This is however non-trivial as object geometry varies strongly even within one category. Therefore, we propose a procedural method based on the key observation that humans interact similarly with objects of the same category. By transferring contacts from captured interactions to new object instances, we procedurally scale up the shape variations of real interaction datasets. The task involves solving four different sub-problems, as outlined in Fig. 2: 1. Establishing dense semantic correspondences between all objects within one category (Sec. 3.1.1). 2. Transferring contacts from real to synthetic objects, using the obtained correspondences (Sec. 3.1.2). 3. Jointly optimizing human and object to the newly obtained contacts under a set of constraints (Sec. 3.1.3). 4. Rendering novel intersection pairs with textures to make them available as training data (Sec. 3.1.4). 3.1.1 Dense Semantic Correspondence Given two meshes M and M′ of two different objects of the same category, the problem of finding dense correspondence amounts to finding a bijective map ψ : M →M′, which maps points from one mesh to their semantic counterparts on the other. In cases of arbitrary meshes with changing topology, this problem is heavily ill-posed [3, 21, 79]. Thus, we turn to an approximate solution on discrete surface samples that leverages the regularization and output ordering of MLPs[50] and works well on a wide range of input topologies in practice. Let {Mi}M i=1 be a dataset of meshes from the same object category and Pi ∈ RN×3 a point cloud sampled from the surface of Mi. We train an autoencoder f : RN×3 7→RN×3 on {Pi}M i=1 to minimize the Chamfer distance between predicted and input point clouds. The network f consists of a PointNet [66] encoder and a three-layer MLP decoder that takes unordered points as input and output ordered points. We found that the MLP decoder learns to reconstruct the objects as a mixture of low-rank point basis vectors, thus it automatically provides dense correspondence across objects through the order in the output, as also found in [79, 92, 115]. Effective training of this network requires all shapes to be roughly aligned in a canonical space. When shapes are not aligned, we use ART [115] which uses an additional network to predict an aligning rotation. To ensure the reconstruction quality, we overfit one network per object category. We show some example reconstructions and correspondences for chairs in Fig. 2B. 3.1.2 Contact Transfer Given dense correspondences between a set of point clouds, we use them to transfer contact maps from one object to the other. Let (H ∈RM×3, P ∈RN×3) be a pair of human and object point clouds from an existing interaction dataset. And let T ∈SE(3) be the non-rigid transformation that brings the object point cloud into canonical space where shapes are roughly aligned. Then, we can find our contact set as a set of point pairs from human and object that lie within a distance σ to each other: \\mat hc a l {C } =\\{(i,j) \\mid | |\\mathbf {H}_i-\\mathbf {T}^{-1}f(\\mathbf {T}\\mathbf {P})_j)||^2_2<\\sigma \\} \\textnormal {.} \\label {eq:contact-points} (1) We first bring P into canonical pose, then apply f to obtain a coherent point cloud, which is brought back into interaction pose by T−1. Since our autoencoder f produces coherent point clouds, the obtained contact set can be directly transferred to all other objects P′ within the category, allowing us to pair the human with all other objects, one example",
        "transfer is shown in Fig. 2C. Once we transfer the contact points to the new object, we can find the corresponding contact facets in the meshes that have the smallest distances. 3.1.3 Contact-based Joint Optimization The newly obtained contact sets define how and where a human should interact with the new object. We can also transform the object from canonical to interaction pose with our dense correspondence. However, this naive placement does not guarantee the plausibility of the interaction due to object geometry changes (see Fig. 2D). Hence, we propose a joint optimization to refine the human and object pose such that: a) contact points are close to each other, b) contact face normals match, and c) interpenetration is avoided. We use the SMPL-H [57, 68] body model H(θ, β) to parameterize the human as a function of pose θ and shape β parameters. The object pose is given as non-rigid transformation T ∈SE(3), and we denote the new object point cloud to which we have transferred contacts as P′. We find the refined human-object poses jointly, by minimizing: L( \\p os e , \\ s hape , \\mat h bf {T}) = \\lambda _c L_c + \\lambda _n L_n + \\lambda _\\text {colli} + \\lambda _\\text {init} L_\\text {init} \\textnormal {,} \\label {loss-joint-opt} (2) where the individual loss terms are given as: • Contact: Lc = P (i,j)∈C ||Hi −P′ j||2 2, minimizing the distance between contact points. • Normal: Ln = P (i,j)∈C ||1 + nT i nj||2 2, ensuring that normals ni, nj of contacting faces point in opposite directions. • Interpenetration: Lcolli penalizing interpenetration based on the bounding volume hierarchy [88]. • Initialization: Linit is the L2 distance between new and original human pose, regularizing the deformation. The pose θ is initialized from the original human pose and β is randomly sampled from a set of registered scans [4]. The object pose T is initialized by Procrustes alignment between the two coherent point clouds P′ and P. After joint optimization we obtain realistic interactions, see Fig. 2D. 3.1.4 Dataset Rendering Our contact transfer and joint optimization provide us the skeleton of interaction with new objects. To render them as images, we take the optimized SMPL-H parameters from Sec. 3.1.3 and randomly sample the clothing deformation and texture from SMPL+D registrations in MGN [4]. For objects, we use the original texture paired with the mesh. We render the scenes in Blender [16], which is detailed in supplementary. See example renderings in Fig. 2E. Method Scalability. We emphasize that the proposed procedural generation is a scalable solution that can generate large-scale datasets with only a small amount of effort for data capture: with 2k different interactions (e.g. BEHAVE [7] chair interaction), 6k different objects (e.g. Shapenet chairs [12]) and 100 human scans (e.g. MGN [4]), one can have maximum 1.2 billion different variations in total, which is not possible with real data capture. The data scale allows for training powerful models that reach performance not obtainable by training on real data only. An example of such a method is detailed in the next section. 3.2. HDM: Hierarchical Diffusion Model Modelling the joint shape space of humans interacting with objects is difficult since the product of human and object shape variations is huge. One solution is to use two separate networks that reconstruct human and object respectively. However, such a method ignores the interaction cues that have been show important for coherent reconstruction [7, 95, 96, 105]. This motivates us to design a hierarchical solution where we first jointly estimate both human and object(Sec. 3.2.2), and then use separate networks that focus on refining individual shape details (Sec. 3.2.3). An overview of our method can be found in Figure 3. 3.2.1 Preliminaries Task Overview. Given an input RGB image I of a person interacting with an object, we aim to jointly reconstruct 3D human and object point clouds Ph, Po. Same as prior works [95, 96, 110], we assume known 2D human and object segmentation masks, which we consider a weak assumption, given recent advances in 2D segmentation [43, 45, 75]. Due to the ambiguity from monocular input, we adopt a probabilistic approach for 3D reconstruction, which has been proven effective in learning multiple modes given same input [60, 111, 118]. Specifically, we use a diffusion model [32] to learn the distribution of 3D human object interactions conditioned on a single image. Diffusion models [32, 76] are general-purpose generative models that consist of iterative forward and reverse processes. Formally, given a data point x0 sampled from a data distribution pdata, the forward process iteratively adds Gaussian noise q(xt|xt−1) to the sample x0. The distribution at step t can be computed as: \\ vect { x } _ t &= \\sqrt {\\Bar {\\alpha }_t}\\vect {x}_0+\\epsilon \\sqrt {1-\\Bar {\\alpha }_t} \\label {eq:diffusion-forward} (3) where ¯αt controls the noise level at step t and ϵ ∼ N(0, 1) [32]. The reverse process starts from Gaussian noise at step T and gradually denoises it back to the original data distribution pdata at step 0. At each reverse step, we use a neural network pθ to approximate the distribution: pθ ≈q(xt−1|xt). The network is trained with the variational lower bound to maximize the log-likelihood of all data points, which is parametrized to minimize the L2 distance between the true noise ϵ and network prediction[32]:",

Our hierarchical diffusion model. Given an RGB image of a human interacting with an object, we first jointly reconstruct the human and object as one point cloud with segmentation labels (Stage 1, Sec. 3.2.2). This prediction reasons interaction but lacks accurate shapes. We then use two diffusion models for human or object separately with cross attention to refine the initial noisy prediction while preserving the interaction context(Stage 2, Sec. 3.2.3). Our hierarchical design faithfully predicts interaction and shapes. \\mathca l {L} = E_{t\\sim [1, T] }E_{\\ epsilon _t\\sim \\mathcal {N}(0, \\mat {I})}[||\\epsilon _t - p_\\theta (\\vect {x}_t, t)||^2_2] \\label {eq:diffusion-loss} (4) 3.2.2 Joint Human-object Diffusion In this first stage, we simultaneously predict both human and object hence the output is one point cloud P ∈ RN×3. We adopt PC2 [60] that diffuses point cloud conditioned on single images. Formally, we use a point voxel CNN [56, 117] pθ : RN×D 7→RN×3 as the point diffusion model. Here D is the feature dimension. To obtain perpoint input features, we first use a pre-trained encoder [30] to extract feature grid F ∈RF ×H′×W ′ from input image I, here F and H′, W ′ are feature and spatial dimensions respectively. Points p ∈P are then projected to 2D image plane with π(·) : R3 7→R2 to extract pixel-aligned feature Fπ(p). We further concatenate it with point location and diffusion timestamp encodings tenc as the input to the diffusion model: Fp = (Fπ(p), p, tenc). To allow generative prediction for points that are occluded, the image features Fπ(p) are set to zeros when points are occluded [60]. 3.2.3 Hierarchical Diffusion for Interaction Naively using one network to reconstruct interaction leads to noisy point predictions (see Fig. 5), as the combinatorial shape space of human-object interaction is too complex to model. Thus, we propose a second stage to refine human and object shapes separately, by having two additional diffusion models while also preserving the interaction context. In the following, we discuss special aspects of our second stage, namely 1) how the point cloud is segmented into human and object, 2) how separate networks are designed to model interaction, 3) how these models are combined. Point cloud segmentation. To reason the contacts during interaction and obtain accurate shapes for human and object separately, the combined point cloud needs to be segmented into the points for human and object. To this end, we use an additional network gϕ : RN×D 7→{0, 1}N that takes point features Fp as input and predicts a binary label to indicate whether this is a human or object point. With this prediction, we can segment the point cloud P predicted by pθ into human and object points Ph, Po. Preserving interaction context. In our second stage, we use two additional diffusion models ph θ, po θ to predict human and object. The networks follow the same design as the joint network pθ using PVCNN [56, 117]. To encourage the networks to explore interaction cues, we add cross-attention layers between the encoder and decoder layers of human and object branches. Given downsampled points Pl ∈RNl×3 with features Fl ∈RNl×Dl after network layer l, we propagate information from human branch to object branch by computing feature: \\ma t {F}_l^{h\\ma p st o o} = \\t ext {Attn}(\\text {enc}(\\mat {P}_l^o), \\text {enc}(\\mat {P}_l^h), \\mat {F}_{\\mat {P}^h_l}), \\label {eq:cross-attention} (5) where Attn(Q, K, V) is learnable cross attention[89], enc(·) is positional encoding from NeRF [61], and FPh l = (enc(Ph l ), C) is the concatenation of positional encoding and onehot encoding C indicating these points belong to human. The attention feature Fh7→o l is then concatenated to the object feature Fo l as input to the next layer. We propagate information from object to human branch similarly. Model Combination. With the separate networks ph θ, po θ, one can run the full reverse diffusion process from t = T to t = 0 and then combine the denoised points. However, this does not leverage the predicted interaction context from the joint reconstruction stage and is slow. We hence start the reverse diffusion steps from an intermediate step t = T0 instead of T. Specifically, after denoising and segmentation with the joint model, we apply the forward diffusion process to Ph and Po until step t = T0 using Eq. (3). Then, the individual diffusion models take the noised points as input",

CHORE[95] relies on object mesh templates and the prediction is inaccurate for challenging poses. PC2[60] does not rely on templates but its predicted point clouds are noisy (red circles) and it cannot predict contacts. Ours can reason about human object interaction, and predicts high-fidelity human and object shapes without templates. and gradually denoise them until step t = 0. The forward process destroys local noisy predictions but keeps the global structure of human-object interaction. We set T0 = T 2 , see supp. for analysis of this value. Our hierarchical design is important to obtain sharp predictions, see Tab. 5 and Fig. 5. Recall from Eq. (3) that the forward diffusion ends up with a normal distribution. Hence the input and output points of all diffusion models are centered at the origin and scaled to unit sphere, which requires normalization parameters to project them back to image. We estimate it for the first diffusion model pθ when GT is not available and compute them for separate diffusion models ph θ, po θ from the segmented points. We show in Sec. 4.4 that it is better than directly predicting from input image. More details in Supp. Implementation. We train our diffusion models pθ, ph θ, po θ using the standard loss ( Eq. (4)) and segmentation model gϕ using L2 distance between predicted and ground truth binary labels. See Supp. for more implementation details."

Data generation. We leverage the BEHAVE [7], InterCap [35], ShapeNet [12], Objaverse [19], ABO [15] and MGN [4] dataset to generate our synthetic data ProciGen. BEHAVE and InterCap capture multi-view images of humans interacting with 20 and 10 different objects respectively. ShapeNet [12], Objaverse [19] and ABO [15] provide 3D object models as meshes with textures. The objects from ShapeNet and ABO are aligned in canonical space while objects from Objaverse are not aligned. MGN [4] consists of 100 human scans paired with SMPL-D registration that allows reposing scans while preserving clothing deformation. Following the same split from [96], we randomly sample from 380k interactions in BEHAVE and InterCap training set, 21k different shapes in ShapeNet, ABO and Objaverse, and 100 different human shapes and textures in MGN. In total, we generate ∼1.1million training images. Please see supplementary for more data distribution details. Evaluation metric. We evaluate the reconstruction performance using the F-score based on Chamfer distance between point clouds, which is more suitable for measuring the shape accuracy [82]. We compute F-score with a threshold of 0.01m [60] and report the error for human, object and combined point clouds separately, as typically done in interaction reconstruction methods [95, 96]. 4.1. Reconstruction on BEHAVE and InterCap We compare our method with CHORE [95] and PC2[60] on BEHAVE[7] and InterCap [35] test set in Tab. 2 and Fig. 4. We train CHORE and PC2 on the training set of BEHAVE and InterCap. Our HDM is trained on our synthetic ProciGen with or without BEHAVE and InterCap training set. We also report per-category accuracy in supplementary. CHORE is designed for interaction reconstruction and requires known object templates. PC2 is a general shape reconstruction method without templates but it does not separate human and object hence cannot reason the semantics of interaction. Our method trained only on our synthetic ProciGen dataset performs on par with CHORE which already knows the template and PC2 which already sees the object shapes. After training our HDM on both our ProciGen and real data, our method significantly outperforms baselines. 4.2.

We also report the model performance vs. data amount in supplementary. 4.3. Generalization Performance Our ProciGen dataset allows training shape reconstruction methods to generalize to unseen object instances. To evaluate this, we train CHORE[95], PC2[60] and our HDM model on BEHAVE[7] and our proposed dataset respectively. We then evaluate them on unseen objects of the same categories from InterCap [35] in Table 4. CHORE requires a template to predict 6D pose, which makes it difficult to train on our synthetic dataset with more than 21k different shapes. We hence only train CHORE on BEHAVE dataset. Methods trained on BEHAVE have limited generalization to InterCap (Tab. 4a-c). An alternative to our ProciGen is to randomly scale and shift the objects from BEHAVE and render new images, which only slightly improves generalization (Tab. 4d). In contrast, our ProciGen significantly boosts the generalization performance (Tab. 4e-f). Some qualitative results are shown in Fig. 5. Our method reconstructs human and object with high shape fidelity. We also show the generalization results to COCO dataset [49] in Fig. 6. Our method trained only on our ProciGen data gen-",

Generalization performance of methods trained on BEHAVE [7] (a-c), BEHAVE + random augmentation (d) and our ProciGen (e-f), evaluated on unseen objects from InterCap (F-score@0.01m). CHORE predicts template-specific 6D poses hence does not work on unseen objects from InterCap. PC2 (b) and our method (c) do not require templates but are constrained by the limited shape variations from BEHAVE. Adding random shape augmentation on BEHAVE objects (d) slightly improves generalization but is still suboptimal. With our proposed ProciGen dataset, both PC2 and our method can generalize to InterCap and our method achieves better accuracy. eralizes well to in-the-wild images with large object shape variations. See Supp. for more generalization examples. 4.4. Ablating the Hierarchical Diffusion Model Our HDM predicts interaction semantics and better shapes. In Tab. 5, we ablate other alternatives to our method on the 824 chair images from BEHAVE test set [7] due to resource limit. All methods are trained on our ProciGen dataset. The human-object segmentation allows us to compute the contacts and manipulate human and object separately. An alternative is projecting the predicted points to 2D image and segment points based on the masks. Due to occlusion and complex interaction, this segmentation is inaccurate, as reflected in the large human and object errors in Tab. 5a. The model that predicts human, object and segmentation with a single model (Tab. 5 b) also does not work as it is difficult to learn high-fidelity interaction shapes. Another alternative to our first joint diffusion model is to use a network that predicts translation and scale directly from input image and then use them to combine predictions from two separate models. However, such a global prediction does not model interaction with local fine-level details hence the performance is subpar(Tab. 5b). Our cross attention module also improves the performance (Tab. 5d)."

        "In this paper, we proposed a procedural generation method to synthesize interaction datasets with diverse human and object shapes. This method allows us to generate 1M+ images paired with clean 3D ground truth and train large image-conditioned diffusion models for reconstruction, without relying on any shape templates. To learn accurate shape space for human and object, we introduce a hierarchical diffusion model that learns both the joint interaction and high fidelity human and object shape subspaces.",

CHORE [95] predicts template specific object pose hence cannot generalize to new object instances. PC2[60] does not rely on template but its generalization ability is constrained by limited shape variations from BEHAVE [7]. Training PC2 on our ProciGen improves its generalization but the predicted point clouds are still noisy. Our method is able to generalize and predicts human and object with high shape fidelity.

Projecting PC2 predictions to 2D masks to obtain segmentation (a) is inaccurate and single stage diffusion model (b) cannot learn high-fidelity shapes for both human and object. Combining predictions from separate human and object models using direct translation prediction from images (c) also does not work as it cannot learn fine-grained interactions. Our hierarchical design together with our cross attention module achieves the best result. We train our method with the proposed synthetic dataset and evaluate it on BEHAVE and InterCap datasets. Results show that our method significantly outperforms CHORE which requires template meshes and PC2 which does not reason interaction semantics. Ablation studies also show that our synthetic dataset is important to boost the performance and generalization ability of both PC2 and our model. Our method generalizes well to real images from COCO that have diverse object geometries, which is a promising step toward real in-the-wild reconstruction. Our code and data are released to promote future research. Acknowledgements. We thank RVH group members [2], especially Yuxuan Xue, for their helpful discussions.
