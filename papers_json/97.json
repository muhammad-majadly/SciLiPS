        "Reconstructing animatable and high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular videos, especially with realistic relighting, is a valuable task. However, the limited information from single-view input, combined with the complex head poses and facial movements, makes this challenging. Previous methods achieve real-time performance by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a parametric head model, but the resulting head quality suffers from inaccurate face tracking and limited expressiveness of the deformation model. These methods also fail to produce realistic effects under novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we propose HRAvatar, a 3DGS-based method that reconstructs high-fidelity, relightable 3D head avatars. HRAvatar reduces tracking errors through end-to-end optimization and better captures individual facial deformations using learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning. Additionally, it decomposes head appearance into several physical properties and incorporates physicallybased shading to account for environmental lighting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRAvatar not only re- ∗Intern at IDEA. † Corresponding authors. constructs superior-quality heads but also achieves realistic visual effects under varying lighting conditions.

        "Creating a 3D head avatar is essential for film, gaming, immersive meetings, AR/VR, etc. In these applications, the avatar must meet several requirements: animatable, real-time, high-quality, and visually realistic. However, achieving a highly realistic and animatable head avatar from widely-used monocular video remains challenging. Research in this area spans many years. Early efforts [7, 35, 48] develop parametric head models based on 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) theory [3]. These methods allow registering 3D head scans to parametric models for 3D facial mesh reconstruction. With the rise of deep learning, methods [10, 17, 41, 79] use parametric model priors to simplify head mesh reconstruction from videos, either through estimation or frame-wise optimization, i.e., 3D face tracking. While these methods generalize well for expressions and pose variations, their fixed topology limits complex hair modeling and fine-grained appearance reconstruction. To This CVPR paper is the Open Access version, provided by the Computer Vision Foundation. Except for this watermark, it is identical to the accepted version; the final published version of the proceedings is available on IEEE Xplore.",
        "address this issue, some researchers have turned to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [45] for modeling head avatars [51, 60, 61, 76]. These approaches enable complete geometry and appearance reconstruction, including hair, glasses, earrings, etc. However, they are limited by slow rendering and long training time. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [30] has gained significant attention for its fast rendering speed. Some methods [15, 54, 59, 69] have extended 3DGS to head avatar reconstruction, significantly improving rendering speed compared to NeRF-based methods. Although previous 3DGS-based methods have made progress in animatability and real-time rendering, their reconstruction quality is constrained by two major factors: limited deformation flexibility and inaccurate expression tracking. Additionally, they are unable to produce realistic relighting effects. Specifically, our motivation primarily stems from the following three points. 1) Head reconstruction requires a geometric model to deform from the compact canonical space to various states based on different expressions and poses. Recent methods [54, 59] model geometric deformations of Gaussian points by rigging them to universal parametric model mesh faces. However, parametric models may not accurately capture personalized deformations. 2) Before training, these methods extract FALME parameters by fitting pseudo-2D facial keypoints, which are usually error-prone and lead to suboptimal results. Methods like PointAvatar [78] try to directly optimize these parameters during training. Such a design may introduce a mismatch from pre-tracked parameters and limit generalization to new expressions and poses. Consequently, such methods still require post-optimization during testing. 3) Under monocular and unknown lighting settings, existing 3DGSbased methods directly fit the colors of the avatar, causing an inability to relight and mix the person’s intrinsic appearance with ambient lighting. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose HRAvatar, which utilizes 3D Gaussian points for highquality head avatar reconstruction with realistic relighting from monocular videos, as Fig. 1. We propose a learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning strategy, allowing the Gaussian points for flexible deformation from canonical space to pose space. Additionally, we utilize an expression encoder to extract accurate facial expression parameters in an end-to-end training manner, which not only reduces the impact of tracking errors on reconstruction but also ensures the generalization of expression parameters estimation. To achieve realistic and real-time relighting, we model the head’s appearance by using albedo, roughness, Fresnel reflectance, etc. with an approximate physicallybased shading model. An albedo pseudo-prior is also employed to better decouple the albedo. For a detailed comparison and distinction from previous methods, please refer to the supporting materials. Benefiting from these techniques, HRAvatar can reconstruct fine-grained and expressive avatars while achieving realistic relighting effects. In summary: a) We present HRAvatar, a method for monocular reconstruction of head avatars using 3D Gaussian points. HRAvatar leverages learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning for flexible and precise geometric deformations, with a precise expression encoder reducing tracking errors for high-quality reconstructions. b) We incorporate intrinsic priors to model head appearance under unknown lighting conditions. Combined with a physically-based shading model, we achieve realistic lighting effects across different environments. c) Experimental results demonstrate that HRAvatar outperforms existing methods in overall quality, enabling realistic relighting in real-time and simple material editing."

        "2.1. 3D Radiance Fields Image-based 3D reconstruction has become a vibrant research area due to its photorealistic visuals. NeRF [45] introduced a novel method using MLPs to represent a 3D scene as a continuous density and color field, enabling differentiable image rendering through volume rendering. This approach has inspired numerous follow-up studies [1, 16, 44, 56, 66]. However, NeRF faces heavy computational challenges due to extensive MLP queries. Instant-NGP [46] employs multi-resolution hash encoding to accelerate inference. Additionally, some methods, propose hybrid 3D representations [6, 9, 21] to improve efficiency. Recently, 3DGS introduces an explicit representation using Gaussian points, achieving real-time rendering with an efficient tilebased rasterizer. It rapidly gains attention, and researchers applying it to various fields [11, 12, 26, 32, 50, 57, 67, 68] to exploit its efficiency. Our work also builds upon 3DGS to achieve real-time rendering. 2.2. 3D Head Reconstruction Geometric mesh reconstruction. Traditional 3DMM [3] uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create a parameterized facial model that represents appearance and geometric variations in a linear space. BFM [48] improves on this by adding more scanned facial data, resulting in a richer model. FLAME [35] introduces extra joints for the eyes, jaw, and neck, enabling more realistic facial motion. DECA [20] builds on FLAME by estimating parameters like shape and pose from a single image and capturing finer wrinkles. SMIRK [52] enhances tracking accuracy by using an image-to-image module to provide more precise supervision signals. Besides geometry, some works [8, 18, 19, 33] also focus on learning intrinsic attributes for relightable mesh reconstruction from a single image. Image-based head reconstruction. Recent advances in",

Given a monocular video with unknown lighting and M frames, we first track fixed shape parameter β and pose parameters {θj}M through iterative optimization before training. Expression parameters {ψj}M and jaw poses θjaw are estimated via an expression encoder, which is optimized during training. With these parameters, we transform the Gaussian points into pose space using learnable linear blendshapes BS and linear blend skinning LBS. We then render the Gaussian points to obtain albedo, roughness, reflectance, and normal maps. Finally, we compute pixel colors using physically-based shading with optimizable environment maps. neural radiance fields combine 3DMM for view-consistent, photorealistic 3D head reconstruction, which can be generally divided into two categories. Multi-view-based methods. Some studies explore multi-view video-based head [25, 42, 49, 55, 63] and full-body [36, 38, 39] reconstruction. However, these approaches require multiple synchronized cameras, making them more complex and less convenient than single-phone captures. Although multi-viewbased methods can achieve impressive results, their setup limits the applicability of these approaches. Monocularbased methods. NeRFace [22] extends NeRF to dynamic forms by incorporating expression and pose parameters as conditional inputs, enabling animatable head reconstruction. IMavatar [77] models deformation fields for expression and pose motions, using iterative root-finding to locate the canonical surface intersection for each pixel. Pointavatar [78] introduces a novel point-based representation for more efficient animatable avatars. While Point-avatar learns person-specific deformation fields through a shared MLP, our method independently learns per-point blendshapes basis and blend weights, leading to a more flexible deformation modeling. INSTA [80] speeds up training by using multi-resolution hashing for 3D head representation. Recent works [54, 59] based on 3DGS achieve significant breakthroughs in rendering speed. 3D Gaussian Blendshapes (GBS) [43] learn Gaussian basis to better handle expression movements but struggle with pose variations. In contrast, our method utilizes learnable linear blend skinning for flexible point pose transformations, enabling better handling of person-specific head pose animation, while also providing realistic relighting effects. 2.3. Neural Relighting Implementing relighting in reconstructed 3D scenes is difficult. For static scenes, some methods [23, 62, 72] use learning-based approaches to learn relightable appearances from images under varying lighting. In contrast, inverse rendering methods [4, 70, 73, 74] leverage reflection models like BRDF for more realistic relighting. Recent works [24, 27] integrate BRDF into 3DGS and methods Wu et al. [58], Ye et al. [65] introduce deferred shading for efficient relighting or specular rendering of static scenes. While simplified physical rendering models can be inaccurate, many methods [28, 37, 58] add fitting-based rendering branches to improve reconstruction results. Although some researchers combine physical reflection models with dynamic radiance fields to achieve relightable head avatars [34, 53, 64], they require data under controlled lighting conditions. Reconstructing relightable 3D head avatars under monocular unknown lighting is still underexplored. Point-avatar models lighting but relies on trained shading networks, unable to flexibly relight through environment maps. Unlike NeRF or 3DGS, FLARE [2] reconstructs avatars with meshes and uses a BRDF for relighting, but the reconstruction quality is limited. Our method not only reconstructs superior head avatars but also supports realistic and real-time relighting."

        "hance expression tracking through end-to-end optimization (Sec. 3.1). We also adopt learning strategy for both linear blendshapes and blend skinning for more flexible deformation of Gaussian points (Sec. 3.2). Physically-based shading is employed to realistically model head appearance, which makes our model achieve realistic relighting (Sec. 3.3). The overall pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 2. 3.1. Precise Expression Tracking Although existing face tracking methods can accurately track head pose and shape parameters, they often struggle to precisely estimate expression parameters. Since these parameters control head expressions, inaccuracies can cause deformation errors, compromising reconstruction quality. To mitigate this issue while maintaining good generalization, we propose to use an expression encoder E to extract more accurate expression parameters, which is end-to-end trained with subsequent 3D avatar reconstruction: {\\ps i ,\\theta ^{jaw}}=\\mathcal {E}(I), \\label {eq4} (1) where ψ and θjaw represent the expression and jaw pose parameters, respectively. Note that traditional fitting-based methods optimize face parameters using pseudo labels (e.g., pre-estimated 2D landmarks). In contrast, our encoder is trained end-to-end during reconstruction, utilizing photometric loss with ground-truth face images for supervision. Hence, the proposed encoder enables more precise expression tracking and maintains good generalization. Since point transformations are sensitive to jaw pose parameters [35], we introduce a regularization loss that constrains the distance between the inferred and pre-tracked jaw poses ˆθjaw: \\m a thcal {L } _{jaw}= \\ left \\|\\hat {\\theta }^{jaw}-\\theta ^{jaw}\\right \\|_2. \\label {eq5} (2) Other pose parameters in θ and shape parameters β are pretracked using [77], with β shared across all frames. 3.2. Geometry Deformation Modeling Like most methods, we employ a deformation model to map points from canonical space to pose space based on expression and pose parameters. However, facial shapes, expressions, and pose deformations vary widely among individuals, making it difficult for parametric head models to accurately recover each person’s unique shape and deformations. To address this, we independently learn per-point blendshapes basis and blend weights adaptively for more flexible geometric deformation. Learnable linear blendshapes. Similar to FLAME [35], we use linear blendshapes to model geometric displacement. For each Gaussian point, we introduce three additional attributes: shape basis S = {S1, ..., S|β|} ∈ RN×3×|β|, expression basis E = {E1, ..., E|ψ|} ∈ RN×3×|ψ| and pose basis P = {P 1, ..., P 9K} ∈ RN×3×9K. These are learnable parameters that fit the individual head shape and deformations. First, we compute the shape offset to displace the points to the canonical space Xc using shape blendshapes: \\ma th c al { BS} ({\\be ta } , {S})= \\sum _{m=1}^{|\\beta |}\\beta ^m{S}^m,~X_{c}=X+\\mathcal {BS}(\\beta ,{S}), \\label {eq6} (3) where BS denotes linear blendshapes and β = {β1, ..., β|β|} ∈R|β| is the shape parameter. Next, we compute expression and pose offsets in the same manner, using expression blendshapes and pose blendshapes to model facial expressions: X _{ e }=X_c +\\ m athcal { B S}(\\ps i ,{E})+\\mathcal {BS}(\\mathcal {R}(\\theta ^*)-\\mathcal {R}(\\theta ^0),{P}) , \\label {eq7} (4) where ψ = {ψ1, ..., ψ|ψ|} ∈R|ψ| is the expression parameter, and θ ∈R3(K+1) is the pose parameter representing the axis-angle rotation of the points relative to the joints. θ∗ excludes the global joint, with K = 4. R(θ) is the flattened rotation matrix vector obtained by Rodrigues’ formula, and θo represents zero pose. Learnable linear blend skinning. After applying linear displacement, we transform Gaussian points into pose space using Linear Blend Skinning (LBS). Each Gaussian point is assigned with a learnable blend weight attribute W ∈RN×K to accommodate individual pose deformations. LBS rotates the points Xe around each joints J (β) and linearly weighted by W, defined as: X _p=\\mat h cal {L B S}(X_e , \\mathcal {J}(\\beta ),\\mathcal {W})={R}_{lbs}X_e+T_{lbs}, \\label {eq8} (5) where J (β) ∈RK×3 represents the positions of the neck, jaw, and eyeball joints. To maintain geometric consistency, the rotation attributes of the Gaussians are also transformed by the weighted rotation matrix Rlbs: Rp = RlbsR. Geometry initialization. To facilitate easier learning, we leverage FLAME’s geometric and deformation priors. We initialize the positions of the Gaussian points through linear interpolation on the FLAME mesh faces. The same method is applied to initialize the blendshapes basis and blend weights. Other geometric attributes, like rotation and scale, are initialized similarly to 3DGS [30]. 3.3. Appearance Modeling 3DGS uses spherical harmonics to model the viewdependent appearance of each point, but it cannot simulate visual effects under new lighting conditions. To overcome this, we introduce a novel appearance modeling approach that decomposes the appearance into three properties: albedo a, roughness o, and Fresnel base reflectance f0. We then utilize a BRDF model [5] for physically-based shading of the image. To enhance efficiency, we apply the",
        "SplitSum approximation technique [29] to precompute the environment map. Shading. First, we render the albedo map A, roughness map O, reflectance map F0, and normal map N using rasterizer. The specular and diffuse maps are then calculated as follows: \\begin { split} I_ { spe c ular} &= I _{env } (\\mat hbf { R}, \\m athbf {O}) \\cdot \\left ( ks \\cdot I_{BRDF}(\\mathbf {O}, \\mathbf {N} \\cdot \\mathbf {V})[0] \\right . \\\\ &\\quad + \\left . I_{BRDF}(\\mathbf {O}, \\mathbf {N} \\cdot \\mathbf {V})[1] \\right ), \\label {eq9} \\end {split} (6) I_{dif f u s e}= \\mathbf {A} \\cdot I_{irr}(\\mathbf {N}), \\label {eq10} (7) where V is the view direction map derived from the camera parameters and R is the reflection direction map, computed as R = 2(N · V)N −V. IBRDF is a precomputed map of the simplified BRDF integral. We use an approximate Fresnel equation ˜F to compute the specular reflectance ks: \\ begi n { sp lit } k s &= \\t i ld e { \\mat h cal {F}}(\\mathbf {N} \\cdot \\mathbf {V}, \\mathbf {O}, \\mathbf {F_0}) = \\mathbf {F_0} + \\left ( \\max \\left (1 - \\mathbf {O}, \\mathbf {F_0}\\right ) \\right . \\\\ &\\quad \\left . - \\mathbf {F_0} \\right ) \\cdot 2^{\\left ( -5.55473 (\\mathbf {N} \\cdot \\mathbf {V}) - 6.698316 \\right ) \\cdot (\\mathbf {N} \\cdot \\mathbf {V})}. \\label {eq11} \\end {split} (8) The final shaded image is computed as: Ishading = Idiffuse + Ispecular. During training, we optimize two cube maps: the environment irradiance map Iirr and the prefiltered environment map Ienv. Ienv(R, O) provides radiance values based on the reflection directions and roughness, while Iirr(N) provides irradiance values based on the normal directions. Normal estimation. Smooth and accurate normals are essential for physical rendering, as rough normals can cause artifacts during relighting. Following Jiang et al. [27], we use the shortest axis of each Gaussian point as its normal n. To ensure the correct direction and geometric consistency, we supervise the rendered normal map N with the normal map ˆN obtained from depth derivatives: \\math c al { L } _ {n orm a l}= \\left \\| \\mathbf {1} - \\mathbf {N}\\cdot \\hat {\\mathbf {N}} \\right \\|_1 . \\label {eq12} (9) Intrinsic prior. Disentangling material properties under constant unknown lighting is challenging due to inherent uncertainties. When reconstructing heads under nonuniform lighting, local lighting effects can be erroneously coupled into the albedo, resulting in unrealistic relighting. To address this, we use an existing model [14] to extract pseudo-ground-truth albedos Agt, supervising the rendered albedos for a more realistic appearance, as Eq. (10). We also constrain the roughness and base reflectance within predefined ranges: o ∈[τ o min, τ o max], f0 ∈[τ f0 min, τ f0 max]. \\math c al { L}_{a l bedo} = \\left \\|\\mathbf {A} - \\mathbf {A}^{gt} \\right \\|_1 . \\label {eq13} (10) 3.4. Optimization During optimization, we retain the point densification and pruning strategy from 3DGS, with additional attributes inherited similarly. In addition to the previously mentioned losses, we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and DSSIM to calculate the error between the rendered image and ground truth, as Eq. (12). We also apply Total Variation (TV) loss Ltv to the rendered roughness map O to ensure smoothness. The total loss function is given in Eq. (11). The weights for each loss component are set as follows: λjaw = 0.1, λ1 = 0.8, λW = 0.1, λnormal = 10−5, λalbedo = 0.25, λtv = 0.02. \\beg i n {s p lit} \\ma t hcal {L}_{total }&=\\mathcal {L } _{rgb}+\\lambda _{jaw}\\mathcal {L}_{jaw}+\\lambda _{normal}\\mathcal {L}_{normal}+\\\\ & \\lambda _{albedo}\\mathcal {L}_{albedo}+\\lambda _{tv}\\mathcal {L}_{tv}(\\mathbf {O}), \\label {eq14} \\end {split} (11) \\be gin { sp lit} \\tex t {whe r e} \\quad \\mathcal {L}_{ rgb} = \\lambda _{1}\\left \\| I_{shading} - I_{gt} \\right \\|_1 +\\\\ (1-\\lambda _{1})\\mathcal {L}_\\mathrm {D-SSIM}(I_{shading}, I_{gt}). \\label {eq15} \\end {split} (12) 4. Experiment 4.1. Experimental Setup Implementation details. We build our model using PyTorch [47] and train it with the Adam optimizer [31] on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Each monocular head video is trained for 15 epochs. All videos are cropped and resized to a resolution of 512 × 512. We run matting (e.g. [13, 40]) to extract the foreground, setting the background to black. Moreover, we follow Zheng et al. [77] to pre-track FLAME parameters for the videos. For our encoder E, we utilize the pre-trained weight from SMIRK [52]. Dataset. We evaluate different methods on 10 subjects from the INSTA dataset [80], which provides pre-cropped and segmented images. Following INSTA, we use the last 350 frames of each video as the test set for self-reenactment evaluation. For a more robust assessment, we include 8 subjects from the HDTF dataset [75], which is collected from the internet. We also include 5 self-captured subjects using a mobile phone. For these two datasets, the last 500 frames are used as the test set. All methods adopt the same cropped and segmented process. Baseline and metrics. We compare our method against several SOTA methods: Point-avatar [78], INSTA [80], Splatting-avatar [54], Flash-avatar [59], and 3D Gaussian Blendshapes (GBS) [43], as well as FLARE [2] for relighting. For each method, we use the official code to generate the results. Note that we disable the post-training optimization of test images’ parameters in Point-avatar to ensure fairness. We use PSNR, MAE∗(MAE × 102), SSIM, and LPIPS [71] to evaluate the image quality. 4.2. Evaluation Quantitative results. We evaluate all methods for selfreenactment, as shown in Tab. 1.

Rigged to FLAME. We replace HRAvatar’s learnable blendshapes and LBS with the deformation method from Qian et al. [49], which rigs Gaussian points to the FLAME mesh. The results in Tab. 2 and Fig. 6 demonstrate that our model improves on metrics and achieves more accurate texture and tooth details. MLP deform. To validate the superiority of independently learning per-point blendshapes basis and blend weights, we follow Point-avatar [78] and use a shared MLP to predict them for each point. The results highlight the advantages of our learning strategy. Without learnable deform. We set the blendshapes basis and blend weights as non-learnable to assess the importance of adapting to individual deformations. This leads to reduced geometry and texture quality. Without exp. encoder. To verify the expression encoder’s effectiveness in extracting expression parameters, we use pre-tracked parameters instead. Results indicate our method better restores facial expressions, including mouth shapes and blinking, and improves performance metrics. Without PBS. This means using the standard 3DGS appearance model instead of our shading model. While the fitting-based method of 3DGS performs well due to more learnable parameters and flexibility, our method achieves comparable results while enabling realistic relighting. Without Lnormal. As shown in Fig. 7, removing normal consistency loss results in chaotic normal maps, causing blocky artifacts during relighting. Without Lalbedo. Without the albedo prior loss, appearance attributes become entangled, causing incorrect coupling of local highlights with albedo. This results in unrealistic relighting effects, with highlights appearing in areas without actual lighting, as shown in Fig. 7."

        "Conclusion. In this paper, we introduce HRAvatar, a novel method for high-fidelity, relightable 3D head avatar reconstruction from monocular video. To address errors incorporated from inaccurate facial expression tracking, we train an encoder in an end-to-end manner to extract more precise parameters. We model individual-specific deformations using learnable blendshapes and linear blend skinning for flexible Gaussian point deformation. By employing physicallybased shading for appearance modeling, our method enables realistic relighting. Experimental results show that HRAvatar achieves state-of-the-art quality and real-time realistic relighting effects."

      "section": "Limitations",
      "chunks": [
        " Limitation. While our method models effectively individual deformations well, it remains constrained by FLAME’s priors when training data is insufficient, affecting control over elements like hair or accessories. Due to 3DGS’s strong texture representation and the limitations of existing albedo estimation models, some shadows or wrinkles may still be mis-coupled into albedo or reflectance, leading to shortcomings in relighting, particularly for specular reflections or shadows. Besides, reconstructing the full head from a monocular video is infeasible for our method with unknown camera poses, even if the back of the head is visible. This is because monocular pose estimation relies on facial key points, which become unreliable when the yaw angle approaches 90 degrees."
